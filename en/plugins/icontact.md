# iContact integration

Mautic can send contacts to [iContact](https://www.icontact.com) upon some contact's action or when they gain some point limit.

## Authorize

In order to connect your iContact account with your Mautic, you'll have to create a iContact app. 

Follow the [tutorial](https://www.icontact.com/developerportal/documentation/register-your-app/) on how to create your iContact APP.

When you have your app created, you should be able to see this screen:

![iContact - create a App Key](/plugins/media/plugins-icontact-authorization-details.png "iContact - create a App Key")

Fill in the right credentials to Mautic - iContact integration:

- App ID = the Application ID you've created
- App username = the username / email you log into your iContact account. (Not the App name)
- App password = The password you've chosen when approving the app.

## Configure the plugin

Navigate to the *Features* tab in the plugin configuration modal box. Select the iContact segment where the Mautic contacts should be pushed into. There should be one segment created by default.

Other configuration options are:
- **Push contacts to this integration** - This option is checked by default. If you uncheck it, the plugin will not push contacts to iContact any more.

## Test the plugin

Follow [these steps](./../plugins/integration_test.html) to test the integration.

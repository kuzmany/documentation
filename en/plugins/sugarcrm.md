To synchronize records from/to SugarCRM you need to use a command from CLI. Use this command:

To push activities of synchronized contacts from Mautic to CRM use the following command:
* `php app/console mautic:integration:pushleadactivity`


Parameters both commands take:
* **--time-interval** This parameter is used to setup the amount of time we want to pull records from. Possible entries: "10 days", "1 day", "10 minutes", "1 minute". Maximum time interval "29 days". Default for both commands is “15 minutes”.
* **--integration=Sugarcrm** to use with SugarCRM integration. In future this command may be used for other integrations.
Parameter specific to php app/console mautic:integration:fetchleads
* **--fetch-all** To synchronize all contacts to and from integration. Preferably, use this command only after installation.

These commands may be used for other integrations.

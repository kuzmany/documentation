## How to test an integration

If you want to test an integration plugin to ensure that it is configured properly, you have 3 options how to do that. A contact can be pushed to integration via these places:

- The Campaign Builder has the *Push contact to integration* action which can be used in the Campaign dripflow.
- The Standalone Form has the *Push contact to integration* action which can be used after a standalone form is submitted.
- The Point Trigger has the *Push contact to integration* action which can be triggered when a contact achieves some point limit.

Use any of those triggers to test the plugin and see if the contact appears in the integration. Here is how the Standalone Form action can be configured:

After you have your form with some fields (for example an email and a first name field) and the Push to an integration (e.g. Hubspot CRM) action, go to the form public URL at http://[yourmautic]/form/[formID], fill in some sample contact information and submit it. Then check the integration to see if the new contact has been created.

## Troubleshooting

If the first name value hasn't been transferred, make sure you mapped the form field value to the contact field value in the form field configuration.
